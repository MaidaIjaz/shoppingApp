I have created an eCommerce website from scratch using HTML and CSS. I have designed the homepage with a banner, featured categories, and products with prices, images, and ratings. It also include sections for latest products, exclusive offers, testimonials, and top brands. At the bottom of the website, I included a footer with four columns. Finally, I made the website responsive for mobile devices by adding a drop-down menu.
